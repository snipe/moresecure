This repo will (eventually) house the code for an opsec 101 reference site that makes understanding how information leakage can allow bad guys to do bad things easier. There's a lot of info out there already, but it's not very approachable, or doesn't give enough real-world examples to help develop the critical thinking skills everyone needs these days.

Watch this space for more and contribute ideas in the Issues.

### Requirements

- The point is not to scare people into not sharing any information, the point is to educate them so they can make their own informed choices about what they share
- Every point raised should have a clear example of how the information disclosure can be used against someone.
