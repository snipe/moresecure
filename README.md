This repo will (eventually) house the code for an opsec 101 reference site that makes understanding how information leakage can allow bad guys to do bad things easier. There's a lot of info out there already, but it's not very approachable, or doesn't give enough real-world examples to help develop the critical thinking skills everyone needs these days.

Watch this space for more and contribute ideas in the Issues.

I may also decide to draw some illustrations and make it more like a zine site, because who doesn't like pictures, right? 


### Context

- The content should be approachable enough for kids to understand, but never dumbed down or pandering. 


### Requirements

- The point is not to scare people into not sharing any information, the point is to educate them so they can make their own informed choices about what they share
- Every point raised should have a clear example of how the information disclosure can be used against someone. If you're not sure how to phrase it in a way that matches the context requirements, just post an issue with your idea and we'll work on it together.
